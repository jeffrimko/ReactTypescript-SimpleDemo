= React/TypeScript Simple Demo
:date: 27 December 2020

== Introduction
This is a simple demo of using https://reactjs.org/[React] with https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript]. This demo provides a page with multiple number input elements whose values are summed together.

== Requirements
This demo was written with the Windows OS in mind although it should be easy enough to run on other operating systems. All dependencies should be listed in the main `_Check_Dependencies.bat` which is generated from `install\dependencies.popyaml` using https://github.com/jeffrimko/PopPage[PopPage]. Local Node modules will be installed when the app is started the first time.

== Usage
A https://pypi.org/project/ubuild/[Ubuild] script is provided at `_Run.py` which should handle the basics like starting/stopping the server and viewing the app.
